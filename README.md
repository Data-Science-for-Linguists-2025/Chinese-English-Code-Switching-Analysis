# Code-Switching Analysis of Stack Exchange Posts

**Author:** Qidu Fu

## Project Summary

This project analyzes Chinese-English code-switching in posts from a Chinese-language Stack Exchange site. The aim is to detect instances of code-switching, measure its frequency, and explore how context (e.g., technical vs. non-technical topics) influences the occurrence of code-switching in this bilingual community. The findings will provide insights into multilingual communication patterns, particularly among bilingual users in online technical discussions.

**Keywords**: **Chinese-English bilinguals**, **code-switching**, **Stack Exchange**, **bilingual communication**, **online communities**

The data for this project will be collected using the **Stack Exchange API**, specifically querying posts from a Chinese-language focused Stack Exchange site. This dataset includes questions and answers from users who engage in bilingual Chinese-English discourse, providing a real-world view of code-switching in online forums.

## Objectives

- **Detect Code-Switching**: Identify instances of code-switching between Chinese and English in Stack Exchange posts.
- **Frequency Analysis**: Measure the frequency of code-switching and analyze its patterns across different domains (e.g., technical vs. non-technical topics).
- **Contextual Influence**: Investigate how context and discourse domain influence the use of code-switching in posts.
- **Linguistic Feature Analysis**: Explore the linguistic features of code-switching, such as sentence structure, word choice, and language transitions.

## Data Collection

Data will be scraped from the **Stack Exchange API**:
- **Site**: Chinese-language focused Stack Exchange site
- **Data**: Posts (questions and answers) from bilingual users

The dataset will include bilingual posts where users switch between Chinese and English, providing a rich source for analyzing code-switching patterns in a technical context.

## Research Questions

1. **How frequently does code-switching occur in social media posts on a Chinese-language Stack Exchange site?**
2. **Is there a significant difference in code-switching frequency across different discourse domains, such as technical versus non-technical topics?**
