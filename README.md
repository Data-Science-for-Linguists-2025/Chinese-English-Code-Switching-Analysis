# Code-Switching Analysis of Social Media Posts

**Author:** Qidu Fu

## Project Summary

This project investigates code-switching between Chinese and English in 
social media posts made by Chinese students, graduates, and soon-to-be graduates. 
The goal is to detect when and how students switch between languages, 
measure the frequency of code-switching, 
and understand its occurrence across different contexts. 

Keywords: **bilingual students**, **code-switching**, 
**Chinese-English**, **multilingual communication**

The data for this project will be scraped from two web pages:
1. [1point3acres Forum - Forum 27](https://www.1point3acres.com/bbs/forum-27-1.html)
2. [1point3acres Forum - Forum 29](https://www.1point3acres.com/bbs/forum-29-1.html)

These forums are popular among Chinese students and professionals, 
making them an ideal source for analyzing code-switching patterns 
in social media discussions about study abroad experiences and academic life. 

The findings will provide insights into bilingual communication patterns 
particularly in contexts such as the **U.S.**, **Canada**, and other foreign 
countries. The analysis will also contribute to improving multilingual 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, 
especially those processing bilingual social media content.

## Objective

- **Detect Code-Switching**: Identify instances of code-switching between 
Chinese and English in the posts.
- **Frequency Analysis**: Measure the frequency of code-switching 
and analyze any patterns in the context (personal vs. academic).
- **Impact on NLP**: Contribute to better multilingual NLP models 
by understanding how bilinguals use multiple languages in social media posts.
