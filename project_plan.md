## Project Plan:  Chinese-English Code-Switching Analysis

### Project Overview

This project investigates Chinese-English code-switching in posts from **users of a Chinese language-focused Stack Exchange site**. Using data obtained through the Stack Exchange API, the study aims to detect and analyze the frequency of code-switching, and explore how context or topic influences the occurrence of code-switching in a real-world, bilingual community. The findings will contribute to understanding multilingual communication dynamics in online platforms, particularly among bilingual users.

**Keywords**: **Chinese-English bilinguals**, **code-switching**, **Stack Exchange**, **bilingual communication**, **online communities**

### Research Questions

1. **How frequently does code-switching occur in social media posts on a Chinese-language Stack Exchange site?**
2. **Is there a significant difference in code-switching frequency across different discourse domains, such as technical versus non-technical topics?**

### Importance of the Study

#### **Cultural Dynamics**  
This project sheds light on how **bilingual individuals** use code-switching within an online community. Understanding these patterns will reveal how users navigate **cultural adaptation** in a global, digital space. It can also provide insights into how users balance linguistic boundaries in online technical discourse, particularly when switching between Chinese and English.

#### **Educational Insights**  
The findings of this study will inform educators and platform developers about the language needs of **bilingual communities** on **technical forums** like Stack Exchange. This can lead to better support for **international users**, particularly those transitioning between languages in academic and professional settings. It will also inform the design of more inclusive communication tools for multilingual users in global digital environments.

### Data Collection & Methodology

**Data Source**: Data will be collected using the **Stack Exchange API**, specifically querying posts from a Chinese-language focused Stack Exchange site. The dataset will include questions and answers from users who engage in bilingual Chinese-English discourse.

**Methodology**:  
1. **Code-Switching Detection**: A **rule-based system** will be implemented to identify instances of code-switching between Chinese and English in the posts. Tools like **language detection libraries** (`langdetect`, `langid`) will be used to flag transitions between the two languages.
2. **Contextual Analysis**: The posts will be classified into various domains (technical, personal, etc.) using **topic modeling** to assess how the context affects the frequency and nature of code-switching.

### Steps and Timeline

#### **Step 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing (2 weeks)**  
- **Task**: Collect and preprocess data from the Stack Exchange API.
- **Details**:
  - Query the Stack Exchange API to collect posts from the Chinese-language site.
  - Clean the data by removing irrelevant characters, URLs, or non-linguistic elements.

#### **Step 2: Code-Switching Detection (3 weeks)**  
- **Task**: Detect instances of code-switching and analyze its frequency.
- **Details**:
  - Implement a **rule-based detection system** to identify code-switching between Chinese and English.

#### **Step 3: Domain Classification (2 weeks)**  
- **Task**: Classify posts into domains and analyze linguistic features associated with code-switching.
- **Details**:
  - Use **topic modeling** to classify posts by domain (e.g., technical, academic, social).
  - Calculate the **frequency** of code-switching in posts.
  - Analyze the relationship between code-switching frequency and different domains (technical vs. non-technical).

#### **Step 4: Reporting & Final Analysis (1 week)**  
- **Task**: Summarize findings and prepare a final report.
- **Details**:
  - Synthesize insights from frequency analysis, domain classification, and linguistic feature exploration.
  - Prepare a comprehensive report outlining the methodology, results, and implications for bilingual communication in online forums.

### Deliverables

1. **Code-Switching Detection Model**: A model that detects instances of Chinese-English code-switching in user posts.
2. **Frequency Analysis Report**: A detailed analysis of how often code-switching occurs and its relationship to different domains (technical vs. non-technical).
3. **Final Report**: A comprehensive summary of the project, including findings, analysis, and implications for multilingual communication in online environments.
